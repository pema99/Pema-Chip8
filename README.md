# Pema-Chip8
A Chip8 interpreter / emulator.
Chip8 is a virtual machine + interpreter built to make game development easy on some early computers, such as the Cosmac VIP and the ETI 660.

This emulator has been my first emulation project ever, and although it is quick and dirty, I have learned very much from making it.
The emulator was written with MonoGame, check Game1.cs to learn how to use the Chip8.cs class.
